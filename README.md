bomberman
=========
never is enough, it is another try to make a decent game.
haha, i need to mention that i tried too to make a easy-to-use game engine, at now
i implemented, image load handling, basic game loop, viewport!, collision and also useless things.
I like to re-invent the wheel, stupid ego.

[see game](https://rawgithub.com/estuardolh/bomberman/master/index.html)
